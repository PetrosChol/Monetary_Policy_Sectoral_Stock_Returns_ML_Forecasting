## Abstract

This project investigates the relationship between U.S. monetary policy and sectoral equity returns. It addresses two main questions: (1) whether monetary policy indicators can predict next-month returns across major stock market sectors, and (2) how sensitive each sector is to changes in interest rates over time. Using monthly data from 2000 to 2024, the study models sector returns with lagged monetary policy variables—specifically the federal funds rate, 10-year Treasury yield, and term spread. Forecasting performance is assessed using out-of-sample tests and machine learning models, while sector sensitivity is analyzed through rolling-window regressions. The findings offer insights for asset allocation strategies, particularly in interest rate-sensitive environments.

## Introduction

Understanding how monetary policy affects equity markets is central to both macroeconomic analysis and investment strategy. While the broad impact of interest rate changes on aggregate stock indices is well documented, sector-level responses remain less thoroughly explored—especially in a dynamic and forward-looking context. This project focuses on the predictive and explanatory power of key U.S. monetary policy indicators: the federal funds rate, the 10-year Treasury yield, and the term spread. By analyzing the effect of these variables on monthly returns of key sector ETFs, we aim to assess both their ability to forecast returns and their influence on sector-specific risk exposure over time. This dual approach not only enhances our understanding of monetary transmission through equity sectors but also contributes practical insights for portfolio construction under varying macroeconomic regimes.
